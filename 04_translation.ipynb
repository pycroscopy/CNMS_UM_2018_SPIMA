    "This document illustrates an example of extracting data out of proprietary raw data files and writing the information\n",
    "into a **Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID)** HDF5 file (referred to as a **h5USID** file) using the\n",

    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any data analysis, we need to access data stored in the raw file(s) generated by the microscope. Often, the\n",
    "data and parameters in these files are **not** straightforward to access. In certain cases, additional / dedicated\n",
    "software packages are necessary to access the data while in many other cases, it is possible to extract the necessary\n",
    "information from built-in **numpy** or similar python packages included with **anaconda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The USID model aims to make data access, storage, curation, etc. simply by storing the data along with all\n",
    "relevant parameters in a single file (HDF5 for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of copying data from the original format to **h5USID** files is called\n",
    "**Translation** and the classes available in pyUSID and children packages such as pycroscopy that perform these\n",
    "operation are called **Translators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, so long as one has the metadata and the actual data extracted from the raw data file,\n",
    "the ``pyUSID.NumpyTranslator`` will correctly write the contents to a h5UID / HDF5 file.\n",
    "Note that the complexity or size of the raw data may necessitate a custom Translator class. However, the rough process\n",
    "of translation is the same regardless of the origin, complexity, or size of the raw data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Investigating how to open the proprietary raw data file\n",
    "* Reading the metadata\n",
    "* Extracting the data\n",
    "* Writing to h5USID file\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this document is to demonstrate how one would extract data and parameters from a Scanning Tunnelling\n",
    "Spectroscopy (STS) raw data file obtained from an Omicron Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) into a h5USID file.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is an [AscTranslator](https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/omicron_asc.py)\n",
    "available in our sister-package - ``pycroscopy`` that can translate these files in just a **single** line,\n",
    "we will intentionally assume that no such translator is available. Using a handful of useful functions in pyUSID,\n",
    "we will translate the files from the source **.asc** format to h5USID files in just a few lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same methodology can be used to translate other data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended pre-requisite reading\n",

    "Before proceeding with this example, we recommend reading the previous documents to learn more about:\n",

    "Import all necessary packages\n",

    "There are a few setup procedures that need to be followed before any code is written. In this step, we simply load a\n",
    "few python packages that will be necessary in the later steps."
